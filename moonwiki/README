MOONWIKI version 0.1
--------------------

* Introduction
  ------------
   
MoonWiki is simple HTTP server with build in wiki engine.
It is simple to install and use. MoonWiki uses TWiki-like
syntax (http://www.twiki.org). 

MoonWiki is written in C and Lua (http://www.lua.org).
C is used to handle communication using sockets. Lua is used for 
the rest: HTTP request parsing and processing, files reading,
converting wiki syntax to HTML, even command line arguments parsing.
Lua 5.0 interpreter is embedded into application.

For now it runs under Microsoft Windows but it shouldn't be
difficult to port it to other platform (e.g. Linux). Only C part
have to be ported.

* License
  -------

MoonWiki is licensed under the terms of the MIT license. Just like 
Lua language itself. Please see LICENSE file for details.

* Building
  --------

You only need C compiler. MoonWiki was compiled using MinGW (http://www.mingw.org).
  
Building MoonWiki is simple:
   * first compile Lua 5.0:
      * modify moonwiki/lua-5.0/build.bat file, especially MINGW_HOME variable
      * run build.bat, it compiles Lua 5.0
      * if you can see "Hello world, from Lua 5.0!" your build is successful
   * then compile MoonWiki itself 
      * modify moonwiki/build.bat file, especially MINGW_HOME variable
      * run build.bat, it compiles MoonWiki
      * the result is executable file moonwiki/MoonWiki.exe 

You can also use 'make', but you also must have some unix shell support. 
Cygwin (http://www.cygwin.com) bash shell is good tool for this purpose.
To build MoonWiki using 'make':
   * modify moonwiki/lua-5.0/config file
   * modify moonwiki/Makefile file
   * run 'make lua' and then 'make'
 
* Installation
  ------------

If you want to install MoonWiki you have to create simple directories structure:

 ... install directory 
   +- MoonWiki.exe                 - executable program
   +- script                       - all lua files
   |  +- config.lua               
   |  |  ...
   |  `- WikiStore.lua
   `- htdocs                       - wiki pages and other files
      +- StartPage.txt             - initial page
      +- moon.jpg                  - logo
      |  ...
      `- other pages
      
I use MoonWiki installed on USB flash drive to store and edit some notes and memos.  
  
* Running
  -------
  
Simple execute MoonWiki.exe program. It starts the web server on localhost. 
Default port is 80, configuration could be changed in script/config.lua file.
Then type URL: http://localhost in your web browser. That's all.
To stop web server just terminate MoonWiki.exe process.

---+ What is it
A WikiWord consists of two or more words with initial capitals, run together. When you type a WikiWord, you establish a hyperlink. It's as easy as that.

WikiWords are styled like this because:

   * It makes Wiki hyperlinks instantly recognizable
   * It leads to interesting Wiki topics
   * It avoids the need to fiddle with HTML tags
   * It avoids over-general topics because at least two words are required

---+ Syntax of a WikiWord
   * Uppercase letter(s)
   * Lowercase letter(s)
   * Uppercase letter(s)
   * Optional lowercase or uppercase letter(s) or number(s)

---++ Good examples
   * WikiWord
   * GoodStyle
   * AVeryLongWikiTopicNameIsAlsoPossible: wherever an uppercase or lowercase letter is allowed, a group of letters of the same case is allowed
   * YearTwoThousand

---++ Bad examples

   * Web: Name without the uppercase letter(s), lowercase letter(s), uppercase letter(s) sequence
   * T5Wiki: Name with number before the uppercase, lowercase, uppercase sequence
   * Md5sumsAfterBurning: Name with number before the uppercase, lowercase, uppercase sequence

---+ Hints

   * Insert WikiWords wherever you can. Rich linking helps to make a Wiki successful.
   * Be specific. All topics share one name space. For example, instead of =FunctionalSpec= write =BreadSlicerFunctionalSpec= because other projects might also have a functional spec topic.
   * To stop a WikiWord from being turned into a hyperlink, insert the text =&lt;nop&gt;= immediately before the WikiWord.
   * It is recommended to create topics with singular names. Plural WikiWords are automatically linked to the singular topic, i.e. the link WikiWords links to the topic WikiWord.
   * Sometimes you have to be creative to find a good WikiName. Examples:
      * To create a topic about the the *Bread Slicer 1.2* product, use =BreadSlicer1dot2= or =BreadSlicer1pt2=, but not =BreadSlicer1.2=.
      * To create a topic about *year 2000*, you could go for =YearTwoK= or =YearTwoThousand=, but not =Year2K= or =Y2K= or =Y2000=.
   * Turn acronyms into WikiWords, i.e. take =FaqIndex= for a "FAQ index" topic.

---+ Compilation

To build MoonWiki you only need C compiler. It was compiled using _MinGW_ (http://www.mingw.org) but probably any other C compiler would work.
  
---++ Using build.bat
Building MoonWiki is simple:
   * first compile _Lua 5.0_:
      * modify =moonwiki/lua-5.0/build.bat= file, especially =MINGW_HOME= variable
      * run =build.bat=, it compiles _Lua 5.0_
      * if you can see _Hello world, from Lua 5.0!_ your build is successful
   * then compile MoonWiki itself 
      * modify =moonwiki/build.bat= file, especially =MINGW_HOME= variable
      * run =build.bat=, it compiles MoonWiki
      * the result is executable file =moonwiki/MoonWiki.exe= 

---++ Using make tool
You can also use _make_, but you also must have some unix shell support. 
_Cygwin_ (http://www.cygwin.com) bash shell is good tool for this purpose.
To build MoonWiki using _make_:
   * modify =moonwiki/lua-5.0/config= file
   * modify =moonwiki/Makefile= file
   * run =make lua= and then =make=
 
---+ Installation

If you want to install MoonWiki you have to create simple directories structure:
<verbatim>
 ... install directory 
   +- MoonWiki.exe                 - executable program
   +- script                       - all lua files
   |  +- config.lua               
   |  |  ...
   |  `- WikiStore.lua
   `- htdocs                       - wiki pages and other files
      +- StartPage.txt             - initial page
      +- moon.jpg                  - logo
      |  ...
      `- other pages
</verbatim>
      
I use MoonWiki installed on USB flash drive to store and edit some notes and memos.  
  
---+ Running
After succesfull installation you can run MoonWiki simple executing =MoonWiki.exe= program. See also RunningAndConfiguration.
